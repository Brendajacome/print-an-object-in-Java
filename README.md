Project Description:
---
The code defines a class that models a person, and in the main method, creates an instance of this class with specific values and prints it on the console.

-A Person object is created with the name "John" and the age 25.

-The person object is printed using the System.out.println(person) method, which internally calls the toString method of the Person object.

-The toString method returns the string "Name: John, Age: 25 years", which is the one displayed in the console.
